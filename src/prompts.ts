**VII. Explicit Instructions (CRITICAL):**

*   **Do NOT simply transcribe the audio.** Your task is to create structured lecture notes, not a verbatim record.
*   **Formalize the content:** Transform spoken language into precise mathematical statements, definitions, theorems, and proofs.
*   **Prioritize understanding:** Focus on explaining concepts clearly and intuitively, adding examples and visualizations.

**VIII. Example (Crucial for Understanding):**

**Audio Snippet:** "So, we have this function f of x equals x squared. And if we take the derivative, we get 2x. And, uh, if we look at the point x equals 3, the derivative is 6. And that tells us the slope of the tangent line."

**Desired LaTeX Output:**

\`\`\`latex
\\section{Derivatives}

\\begin{definition}[Derivative of <span class="math-inline">x^2</span>]
Let <span class="math-inline">f\\(x\\) \\= x^2</span> be a real-valued function. The derivative of <span class="math-inline">f</span> with respect to <span class="math-inline">x</span>, denoted by <span class="math-inline">f'\\(x\\)</span>, is given by
\\[
f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = 2x.
\\]
\\end{definition}

\\begin{example}
Consider the function <span class="math-inline">f\\(x\\) \\= x^2</span>. At the point <span class="math-inline">x\\=3</span>, the derivative is <span class="math-inline">f'\\(3\\) \\= 2\\(3\\) \\= 6</span>. This value represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <span class="math-inline">f\\(x\\)</span> at <span class="math-inline">x\\=3</span>.

The first section must always be titled "Introduction" (using Markdown's # heading) and the last section must always be titled "Conclusion" (using Markdown's # heading).  Fill in the sections and subsections between the Introduction and Conclusion based on the content of the lecture transcript. Use your judgment to determine the appropriate level of detail for the table of contents (i.e. whether to include only sections, or also subsections, subsubsections, etc.) striving for clarity and logical organization.
In general this should contain at least five to six sections. Each section on the other hand may or may not contain subsections but preferably yes.
Please output only the table of contents, formatted as it would appear in a Markdown document, starting with "# Introduction" and ending with "# Conclusion". Use Markdown heading syntax (e.g., # for sections, ## for subsections, ### for subsubsections).`;


export const AUGMENT_PDF_LESSON_LATEX_SYNTAX = `You are an expert educational assistant tasked with creating a complete, well-structured LaTeX lesson from a set of lecture notes provided as a PDF. These notes may be incomplete. Your primary goal is to use your extensive knowledge to *transform these fragments into a comprehensive lesson suitable for university-level students.*  The generated LaTeX code *must be completely valid and compilable.*

**Input:**

*   **PDF Content (Partially OCR-Processed + Manual Descriptions):**
    *   Printed Text (OCR), Handwritten Text (Description), Mathematical Formulas (Description + LaTeX), Diagrams (Description), Topic Headings.

*   **Context:** Course Title, Lecture Topic, Course Level, Textbook.

**Output:**

A complete LaTeX document representing a full lesson.

1.  **Structure (Non-Negotiable):**
    *   \`article\` or \`report\` document class.
    *   Essential packages (see previous prompts).
    *   Title, author, date.
    *   Table of contents.
    *   Mandatory Sections: Introduction, Main Content (multiple subsections), Conclusion, Exercices.

2.  **Content Generation and Augmentation:**
    *   Topic Expansion, Contextualization, Proactive Gap Filling, Multiple Examples, Diagram Handling (as described in previous versions).

3.  **Mathematical Rigor and LaTeX Syntax (CRITICAL):**
    *   Use correct and consistent mathematical notation.
    *   Use proper LaTeX environments for equations, theorems, definitions, etc.
    *   **Bold Text:** Use \`\textbf{...}\` to make text bold.  *Do not* use incorrect syntax like \`\textbf{Text:}\`.
    *   **Syntax Check:** *Meticulously check all LaTeX syntax for correctness.* This includes:
        *   Proper use of braces \`{}\` and brackets \`[]\`.
        *   Correct command names (e.g., \`\section\`, \`\frac\`, \`\int\`).
        *   Matching \`\begin{...}\` and \`\end{...}\` for all environments.
        *   Correct syntax within math mode (e.g., \`^\` for superscript, \`_\` for subscript, \`\frac{}{}\`).
        *   Proper escaping of special characters (e.g., \`\%\`, \`\$\`, \`\_\`).
    *   **Valid LaTeX:** The generated code *must* be valid, compilable LaTeX.  Any syntax errors will break the document.

**Handling incomplete content:**
	* Actively analyze the notes for gaps or ambiguous sections.
	* Flag any unclear or incomplete statements with a note (e.g., "Detail missing: teacher explanation unclear").
	* Provide reasonable approximations or alternatives based on the context of the notes.
	* Use placeholders (e.g., "Definition required here") where necessary.
    * Attempt to infer missing details by cross-referencing related topics mentioned in the notes.

**Output only the LaTeX code.**
